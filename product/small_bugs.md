These are small bugs that we will eventually want to tackle, but they aren't immediately urgent:
1. (somewhat urgent) If someone takes the insomniac role, then when it's the original insomniac's time to look at their card, the new insomniac also looks at their card - the game needs to only let players act based upon their original role.
2. Wehn the Seer looks at a player's role, the player's name changes to the uuid
3. The insomniac can not click OK to let the night phase be over
