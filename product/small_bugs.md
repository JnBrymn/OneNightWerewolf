These are small bugs that we will eventually want to tackle, but they aren't immediately urgent:
1. (somewhat urgent) If someone takes the insomniac role, then when it's the original insomniac's time to look at their card, the new insomniac also looks at their card - the game needs to only let players act based upon their original role.
2. Wehn the Seer looks at a player's role, the player's name changes to the uuid
3. The insomniac can not click OK to let the night phase be over
4. Lone Werewolf gets stuck after making card choice
5. Robber's role should change after it's role, but it shuldn't take the behavior of the other role later (similar to 1)
6. Why does the troublemaker say "you are the insomniac and your role is ..."?
