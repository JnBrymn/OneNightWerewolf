# ONE NIGHT WEREWOLF

In One Night Ultimate Werewolf, each player takes on the role of a Villager, a Werewolf, or a special character. It's your job to figure out who the Werewolves are and to kill at least one of them in order to win – unless you've become a Werewolf yourself!

## ONE NIGHT ROLES

You may use additional roles in your games beyond the basic setup. Just take out a card and replace it with a different one. You may use virtually any combination of cards, though you probably don't want to introduce more than 1 or 2 new roles at a time, so players can easily learn them.

Regardless of which roles are present, you must always have 3 more cards than players.

Before each round, place a token that corresponds to each of the cards in the center of the table. This will ensure that everyone knows what roles are in the game.

Each of the roles has certain effects which change the nature of the game. Some roles clearly help the village team, like the Seer or Mason, while others help the werewolf team, like the Minion.

Don't be too concerned if one team seems to be winning too much; gameplay with One Night tends to evolve over the course of several games.

Be creative in your role selection: try having a single Werewolf, or shuffling all of the cards and dealing them out to players entirely randomly. You can even create a village with no Villager cards – that way everyone has a special role.

The free app makes using the different roles very easy; the app allows you to choose exactly which roles are in the game (that wake up at night), and then reads them in the correct order, and even takes care of anomalies for things like when there is a Doppelgänger and Minion in the game.

## ROLES THAT WAKE UP AT NIGHT

These roles wake up at night in the following order. Within each of the role descriptions is a sample script which the Announcer may use.

### DOPPELGÄNGER

The Doppelgänger is a fairly complicated card, because she takes on the role and team of whatever card she views. The Doppelgänger wakes up before the other roles.

At night, the Doppelgänger looks at (but does not switch) one other player's card and does the following based on what she sees:

* Villager, Tanner, Hunter: She is now that role and does nothing else at night.
* Werewolf or Mason: She wakes up with the other Werewolves or Masons when they are called.
* Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Drunk: She immediately does that role's action.
* Minion: She is on the werewolf team and sees the Werewolves.
* Insomniac: She wakes up at the end to view her card.

If a player receives the Doppelgänger card during the night, she is the role the Doppelgänger originally viewed.

### WEREWOLF

At night, all Werewolves open their eyes and look for other Werewolves. If no one else opens their eyes, the other Werewolves are in the center. Werewolves are on the werewolf team.

Lone Wolf Option: If there is only one Werewolf, the Werewolf may view one center card.

### MINION

Immediately following the Werewolf phase, the Minion wakes up and sees who the Werewolves are. Werewolves put their thumbs up so the Minion can see them. The Werewolves do not know who the Minion is.

If the Minion dies and no Werewolves die, the Werewolves win. If no players are Werewolves, the Minion wins if one other player dies.

### MASON

When using the Masons, always put both Masons in the game. The Masons wake up and look for each other. If a Mason sees no one else, the other Mason is in the center. Masons are on the village team.

### SEER

At night, the Seer may look at one other player's card or two of the center cards without moving them. The Seer is on the village team.

### ROBBER

At night, the Robber may exchange his card with another player's card and then view his new card. The Robber is now on the team of the card he took, but does not perform that role's night action.

If the Robber does not exchange cards, he remains the Robber.

### TROUBLEMAKER

At night, the Troublemaker may exchange the cards of two other players without looking at them. The Troublemaker is on the village team.

### DRUNK

The Drunk exchanges his card with a card from the center but does not look at his new card. He is now that role and on that team.

### INSOMNIAC

The Insomniac wakes up at the end of the night and looks at her card to see if it has changed. Only use the Insomniac if the Robber or Troublemaker is in the game.

---

## NO-WAKE ROLES

### VILLAGER

The Villager has no special abilities. The Villager is on the village team.

### TANNER

The Tanner only wins if he dies. The Tanner is not on the village or werewolf team.

### HUNTER

If the Hunter dies, the player he is pointing at also dies. The Hunter is on the village team.

## THE ORIGINAL ONE NIGHT WEREWOLF

The original Japanese version of One Night Werewolf was released in January 2013 and became a major hit in Japan. By being playable with 3–7 players and taking only about 10 minutes, it solved many issues of traditional Werewolf games. It became the basis for One Night Ultimate Werewolf, the expanded deluxe version.
