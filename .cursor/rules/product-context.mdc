# Product Context (One Night Werewolf)

At the **start of each conversation**, read the `product/` directory to ground your work:

1. **product/product_design.md** — product design and goals
2. **product/instructions.md** — One Night Werewolf game rules/instructions
3. **product/implementation_steps.md** — implementation plan and current progress

Optionally check `product/small_bugs.md` and `product/random_ideas.md` when relevant.

Use this context to align suggestions with the intended design and to know roughly where we are in the implementation.
